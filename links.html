            <li>Check out <a href="https://www.anseladams.com/">Ansel Adams</a> here. He's one of my all-time 
                favorites and a great way to get into the art and hobby of photography.</li>
            <li> One of the greatest street photographers ever was a man named 
                <a href="https://www.saulleiterfoundation.org/">Saul Leiter</a>. Take a 
                look at some of his work.</li>
            <li>Another forefather of the street photography movement was 
                <a href="http://www.henricartierbresson.org/">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>who coined the term 
                "decisive moment" in the photography world. He is nothing short of legendary.</li>
            <li>Here's a look at <a href="https://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/">Joel Meyerowitz</a>. Like Saul
                Leiter, he helped usher in the heyday of street photography.</li>
            <li>Across the globe, <a href="https://www.moriyamadaido.com/">Daido Moriyama</a> was doing 
            incredible things to further street photography as a respected aspect of the art.</li>
