                    <q>Welcome to Pho-Blog-Graphy. This is intended to be a place 
                    where anyone who loves photography can write about any aspect 
                    of it that they want to share with the world. I am the moderator 
                    of this site, my name is Craig. Please be patient with me while 
                    the site is still being built. We will have a submission form for 
                    anyone who wants to share, but we're not quite there yet. Keep up 
                    with this blog to see how things are shaping up. Also, please be considerate
                    and approproate when sharing on the site. There's no harm in 
                    disagreements, just have them respectfully and then we can all 
                    learn from each other. Enjoy, and have a great time on the site!</q>
