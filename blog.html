                    <q>Welcome to Pho-Blog-Graphy. This is intended to be a place 
                    where anyone who loves photography can write about any aspect 
                    of it that they want to share with the world. I am the moderator 
                    of this site, my name is Craig. Please be patient with me while 
                    the site is still being built. We will have a submission form for 
                    anyone who wants to share, but we're not quite there yet. Keep up 
                    with this blog to see how things are shaping up. Also, please be considerate
                    and approproate when sharing on the site. There's no harm in 
                    disagreements, just have them respectfully and then we can all 
                    learn from each other. Enjoy, and have a great time on the site!</q>

                    <q>So todays blog post is going to be about sensors. Specifically the Advanced Photo 
                        System type 'C' - or, the APS-C - sensor. The APS-C sensor is a smaller, lighter 
                        sensor used in a number of cameras that are geared to the beginner, hobbyist, or 
                        anyone looking for a small camera with a lot of photographic chops. Being smaller, it
                        doesn't take in the same amount of light that a full-frame sensor would, and the smaller 
                        pixels produce more noise at higher ISOs. You can expect greater depth of field if you 
                        are using an APS-C sensor in your camera. My camera is a Canon M200, which is a small, 
                        mirrorless digital camera with interchangability of lenses and - you guessed it - an
                        APS-C sensor. While this is a great sensor - especially if you fit into one of the 
                        categories above - there is one thing you need to understand to utilize it to the 
                        best of it's abilities, and that thing is what's called: Crop Factor. Since the 
                        sensor is smaller than a full-frame sensor, it accepts light slightly differently. 
                        For instance, let's look at a 35mm lens on a full-frame sensor. 35mm is one of 
                        the most commonly used focal lengths, and one of the most commonly sold prime lenses 
                        (a prime lens only has one focal length). A 35mm lens on a full-frame sensor would be 
                        equivalent to a roughly 52.5mm lens on an APS-C sensor. So what is Crop Factor? 
                        It's what determines the conversion point. For Nikon, Sony, and Fujifilm cameras, the 
                        crop factor is 1.5x. For Canon cameras it's 1.6x. In the next blog post we'll make a 
                        table to show you all the most common focal lengths and their associated conversion 
                        sizes. Until next time! Happy hunting out there with those cameras.</q>
